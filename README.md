# Agent Architecture Kit

A GitHub-ready product repository for reusable agent-system architecture patterns.

This repository packages a set of architectural contours that emerged from real operator use and iterative refinement:

- memory as selective continuity rather than transcript storage;
- task state as operational source of truth;
- truth resolution across memory, tasks, and artifacts;
- thin-main / bounded isolated execution;
- regression and promotion-gate discipline for architecture changes.

The goal is not to ship one monolithic framework, but a clear architecture kit that others can read, adapt, and implement in their own agent systems.

This repository now includes both architecture docs and a minimal Python reference implementation.

## What is inside

### Core architecture contours

A deeper export now also lives under `docs/architecture/`, `docs/memory/`, and `docs/evaluation/`.

1. **Memory Contour**
   - retrieval
   - distillation
   - protected memory
   - truth hierarchy
   - memory write discipline

2. **Task State Contour**
   - task manager as operational source of truth
   - task / artifact / memory separation
   - lifecycle discipline
   - status and dependency semantics

3. **Execution Contour**
   - thin main orchestrator
   - bounded isolated execution
   - explicit ownership
   - ACK / DONE / BLOCKED handoff contract
   - retry and escalation budgets

4. **Evaluation Contour**
   - regression harnesses
   - protected cases
   - comparable coverage
   - dataset delta checks
   - promotion gate realism

5. **Truth Resolution Contour**
   - domain-specific source of truth
   - canonical-over-raw resolution
   - freshness and supersession handling
   - conflict-aware retrieval/application

## Who this is for

This repo is useful if you are building:

- an assistant that works across many sessions;
- a tool-using agent that needs durable state;
- a task-driven operator assistant;
- an architecture/eval loop for agent improvement;
- a system where chat history alone is not a sufficient memory model.

---

## Core ideas in one page

### 1. Memory is not full transcript retention
Useful memory is selective.
It should preserve decisions, patterns, anti-patterns, blockers with reuse value, and canonical references.

### 2. Tasks are not the same as memory
A task registry remembers work state.
Memory remembers meaning.
Artifacts remember detail.

### 3. Truth is domain-specific
For task status, the task registry should win.
For long-term user preferences, curated memory should win.
For deep implementation context, linked artifacts often win.

### 4. Main should stay thin
The conversational surface should remain an orchestration and decision surface, not the default sink for heavy execution.

### 5. Every architecture claim should be testable
If a contour matters, it should be evaluable, regression-protected, and measurable.

---

## Suggested public/private split

### Public-safe by default
- architecture principles
- neutral schemas
- examples with redacted specifics
- evaluation methodology
- generic handoff contracts
- generic memory/task patterns

### Keep private or sanitize first
- real chat ids
- user-specific memory
- private artifacts and operational logs
- secrets, tokens, infrastructure details
- environment-specific paths unless intentionally documented

---

## How to use this repo

### Option A — Read-only architecture reference
Use the docs as a design guide while implementing in your own stack.

### Option B — Starter kit
Adopt the schemas, examples, policy ideas, and minimal Python modules as a scaffold for your own architecture.

### Option C — Evolving architecture repository
Treat this repo as a living product surface:
- document contours;
- add examples;
- add evaluation cases;
- version changes explicitly.

---

## Initial roadmap

- [ ] refine architecture overview into v1 public form
- [ ] convert internal patterns into sanitized public docs
- [ ] add machine-readable policy/eval examples
- [x] add regression case examples
- [x] add minimal Python reference implementation
- [x] add reference implementation notes for evaluation/release gates

## License

TBD by repository owner.

A practical choice is usually one of:
- MIT — most permissive;
- Apache-2.0 — permissive with patent language;
- AGPL-3.0 — forces networked derivatives to stay open.
